# Weather-App
SheCodes Plus Final Project
Requirements to project
Improve the project you've worked on and implement all features not yet implemented. Search engine, API integration, wind speed, weather description, and weather icon are mandatory. The forecast and unit conversion are optional but everything thatâ€™s included in your code should be fully working (no fake data).
Host your project on Netlify, and at the bottom of your page, link to your GitHub repository.
